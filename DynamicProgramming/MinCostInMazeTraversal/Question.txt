1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows.
2. You are given a number m, representing the number of columns.
3. You are given n*m numbers, representing elements of 2d array a, which represents a maze.
4. You are standing in top-left cell and are required to move to bottom-right cell.
5. You are allowed to move 1 cell right (h move) or 1 cell down (v move) in 1 motion.
6. Each cell has a value that will have to be paid to enter that cell (even for the top-left and bottom- 
     right cell).
7. You are required to traverse through the matrix and print the cost of path which is least costly.
