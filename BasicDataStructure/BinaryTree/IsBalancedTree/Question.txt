1. You are given a partially written BinaryTree class.
2. You are required to check if the tree is balanced. A binary tree is balanced if for every node the gap between height's of it's left and right subtree is not more than 1.
3. Input is managed for you. 

Note -> Please refer the question video for clarity.

Constraints
Time complexity must be O(n)
Space should not be more than required for recursion (call-stack)

Format
Input
Input is managed for you.

Output
true if the tree is balanced, false otherwise
